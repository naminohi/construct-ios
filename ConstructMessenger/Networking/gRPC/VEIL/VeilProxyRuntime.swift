//  VeilProxyRuntime.swift
//  Construct Messenger
//
//  Narrow protocol isolating all `veil_proxy_*` C FFI symbols from policy logic.
//
//  The runtime owns **no** policy — it does not know about ICE mode, DPI detection,
//  cooldowns, relay quality scores, or gRPC. `VeilProxyManager` decides which transport
//  to start; the runtime executes the C call and returns a typed result.
//
//  Conforming to `Sendable` allows the runtime to be referenced from nonisolated
//  contexts (e.g. test mocks, future async wrappers).
//

/// for test ergonomics — production code paths must not use them.
