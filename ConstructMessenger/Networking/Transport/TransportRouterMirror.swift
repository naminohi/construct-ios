//  Main-actor observable surface for the transport router.
//
//  The router itself is an actor — SwiftUI cannot observe actor state directly. This
//  mirror is a tiny @MainActor @Observable class that the router pushes updates to.
//  Views observe this object; the actor remains the single owner of the FSM state.
