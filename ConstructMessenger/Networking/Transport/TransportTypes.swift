//  TransportTypes.swift
//  Construct Messenger
//
//  Foundation types for the unified transport routing layer.
//
//  Design goals:
//  • All transport decisions are expressed as transitions of a single FSM.
//  • The reducer is a pure function (state, event, config, now) -> (state, [Effect]).
//  • All types are Sendable so the FSM can be driven from an actor without ceremony.
//  • No reference to gRPC, ICE proxy, or any specific I/O — that lives in effectors.
